Record the cases of testing large language models

Since OpenAI released ChatGPT at the end of November 2022, I have designed a variety of questions based on the Chinese linguistics to investigate language performance of ChatGPT. Some of the inspection results are stored and backed up here, mainly for GPT3.5 and GPT-4 test results.

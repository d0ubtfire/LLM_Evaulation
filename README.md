# LLM_Evaulation

All files stored in this folder are test results for large language models (especially ChatGPT and GPT-4 developed by OpenAI), showing the performance of large language models in completing these test tasks. These tests are mainly designed from the perspective of linguistics. The language involved in the questions is mainly Mandarin Chinese.

Since OpenAI released ChatGPT at the end of November 2022, I have designed a variety of questions based on the Chinese linguistics to investigate language performance of ChatGPT. Some of these test results reflect the amazing ability of large language models to understand Chinese, and some reflect that large language models still have insufficient understanding of natural language. By testing the language capabilities of large language models, it may help us gain a deeper understanding of the nature of natural language.

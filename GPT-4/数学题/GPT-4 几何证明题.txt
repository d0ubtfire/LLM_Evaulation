Given: Triangle ABC, with ∠ACB = 90° and D as the midpoint of AB

To prove: CD = 1/2 AB

Proof:

D is the midpoint of AB, so AD = DB = 1/2 AB (By definition of midpoint)

Consider triangles ADC and DCB

In ∆ADC, we have ∠DAC = ∠ACB = 90° (Given)

Similarly, in ∆DCB, we have ∠DCB = ∠ACB = 90° (Given)

So ∆ADC and ∆DCB are right triangles with a common hypotenuse AC

Also, AD = DB (From step 1)

So, we can say that ∆ADC ≅ ∆DCB by the Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) theorem of congruent triangles, which states that if a right triangle has a hypotenuse and one leg equal to the hypotenuse and a corresponding leg of another right triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

Thus, by corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent (CPCTC), we have CD = CD, implying that CD is equal to itself in both triangles.

Therefore, CD = 1/2 AB

So, we have proved that CD = 1/2 AB.

Given: Triangle ABC, with ∠ACB = 90° and D as the midpoint of AB.

To Prove: CD = 1/2 AB

Proof:

Step 1: Prove that ∆ADC and ∆DCB are isosceles

D is the midpoint of AB, so AD = DB = 1/2 AB. (By definition of midpoint)

In ∆ADC and ∆DCB, we have ∠DAC = ∠DCB = 90°. (Given)

Since in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal, and here we have one base angle in each triangle equal (90 degrees), the other base angle must also be equal in each triangle.

Hence, ∠ADC = ∠BCD.

By definition, a triangle with two equal angles is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, ∆ADC and ∆DCB are isosceles triangles.

Step 2: Prove that CD = 1/2 AB

As ∆ADC and ∆DCB are isosceles triangles, and by definition of an isosceles triangle, we know that the lengths of the two sides opposite the equal angles are equal. So, we have AC = CD in ∆ADC and BC = CD in ∆DCB.

In right ∆ACB, since ∠ACB = 90°, by the Pythagorean Theorem, we have AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2. Since AC = BC = CD (from the above point), we have AB^2 = 2*CD^2.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get AB = sqrt(2)*CD.

Therefore, CD = AB/sqrt(2) = 1/2*sqrt(2)*AB = 1/2 AB (since AB is twice of AD or DB and AD=DB=CD in isosceles triangles ADC and DCB).

So, we have proved that CD = 1/2 AB.

Given: Triangle ABC, with ∠ACB = 90° and D is the midpoint of AB.

To Prove: ∆ADC and ∆DCB are isosceles.

Proof:

D is the midpoint of AB, so AD = DB = 1/2 AB. (By definition of midpoint)

In ∆ABC, ∠ACB is a right angle (Given). Therefore, ∠CAB + ∠BCA = 90°. (Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, and one angle is 90°, the other two angles must add up to 90°)

Now consider triangle ∆ADC. ∠ADC is an acute angle and is part of the right ∆ABC. Hence, ∠ADC = ∠BCA. (From step 2)

Similarly, consider triangle ∆BCD. ∠BCD is an acute angle and is part of the right ∆ABC. Hence, ∠BCD = ∠CAB. (From step 2)

Now, we know in each triangle ∆ADC and ∆BCD, we have one angle equal to 90° and one other angle equal (Step 3 and 4). Therefore, the third angle in each of these triangles must also be equal. This implies ∠ACD = ∠BDC.

Since ∠ACD = ∠BDC and ∠ADC = ∠BCD, by the base angles theorem, ∆ADC and ∆BCD are isosceles triangles. (Because in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal)

So, we have proved that ∆ADC and ∆DCB are isosceles.

To Prove: ∆DAC and ∆DBC are isosceles.

Proof:

D is the midpoint of AB, so AD = DB. (By definition of midpoint)

In ∆ABC, ∠C is a right angle (Given). Therefore, ∠A + ∠B = 90°. (Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, and one angle is 90°, the other two angles must add up to 90°)

Now consider triangle ∆DAC. ∠ADC is an acute angle and is part of the right ∆ABC. Hence, ∠ADC = ∠B. (From step 2)

Similarly, consider triangle ∆DBC. ∠BDC is an acute angle and is part of the right ∆ABC. Hence, ∠BDC = ∠A. (From step 2)

In triangle DAC, we have AD = DC (as AD = DB from step 1 and ∠ADC = ∠B implies ∠ADC = ∠DAC by vertical angles). Hence, DAC is an isosceles triangle.

Similarly, in triangle DBC, we have DB = DC (as AD = DB from step 1 and ∠BDC = ∠A implies ∠BDC = ∠BDC by vertical angles). Hence, DBC is an isosceles triangle.

So, we have proved that ∆DAC and ∆DBC are isosceles.

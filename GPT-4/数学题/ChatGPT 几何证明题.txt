To prove that triangles ADC and DCB are isosceles triangles, we need to show that two of their sides are congruent in each triangle.

Given:

Triangle ABC with ∠ACB as a right angle.
D is the midpoint of AB.
Proof:

Since D is the midpoint of AB, we can conclude that AD = DB. (Definition of midpoint)

In triangle ADC:

AC is the hypotenuse since ∠ACB is a right angle.
AD = DB (from step 1).
Therefore, triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle with AD = DC. (By definition of an isosceles triangle)
In triangle DCB:

CB is the hypotenuse since ∠ACB is a right angle.
AD = DB (from step 1).
Therefore, triangle DCB is an isosceles triangle with DB = DC. (By definition of an isosceles triangle)
Thus, we have proven that triangle ADC and triangle DCB are isosceles triangles.

Triangle ABC, ∠ACB is a right angle, D is the midpoint of AB. Prove: triangle ADC and DCB are isosceles triangles.If ∠C is a right angel, so AB is is the hypotenuse.
if ∠A is a right angel, so BC is is the hypotenuse. 
If ∠B is a right angel, so AC is is the hypotenuse.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's consider the correct cases based on the given information:

Case 1: If ∠C is a right angle, then AB is the hypotenuse.

Proof:

Given that ∠ACB is a right angle.
In triangle ADC:
AD = DB (since D is the midpoint of AB)
AC ≠ DC (hypotenuse ≠ leg)
Therefore, triangle ADC is not an isosceles triangle.
In this case, we cannot prove that triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle.

Case 2: If ∠A is a right angle, then BC is the hypotenuse.

Proof:

Given that ∠ACB is a right angle.

In triangle ADC:

AC is the hypotenuse (as ∠A is a right angle)
AD = DB (since D is the midpoint of AB)
Therefore, triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle with AD = DC.
In triangle DCB:

BC ≠ DC (hypotenuse ≠ leg)
Therefore, triangle DCB is not an isosceles triangle.
In this case, only triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle.

Case 3: If ∠B is a right angle, then AC is the hypotenuse.

Proof:

Given that ∠ACB is a right angle.
In triangle ADC:
AC ≠ AD (hypotenuse ≠ leg)
Therefore, triangle ADC is not an isosceles triangle.
In this case, we cannot prove that either triangle ADC or triangle DCB is an isosceles triangle.

In conclusion, based on the given information, the only case in which we can prove an isosceles triangle is when ∠A is a right angle, and BC is the hypotenuse, resulting in triangle ADC being an isosceles triangle with AD = DC.

1. The story states that while John was away at school, Mark took the cat out of the basket and put it in the box. So when the cat jumps out, it would be jumping out of the box.
2. The story states that John put the cat in the basket before leaving for school. Since John was not there when Mark moved the cat to the box, John is not aware of this and still thinks the cat is in the basket where he left it.
3. Since John does not know that Mark moved the cat to the box, when John comes home he will still be looking for the cat in the basket, where he thinks the cat is. John is unaware that the cat is actually in the box.

Mark called John very anxiously, and only said one word, telling John to go home immediately and take the cat to the company. Where will John look for the cat first when he gets home? If John didn't find the cat and called Mark back, what would John say? Please give your answer and explain why.

Based on the story, when John first gets home after Mark's call, John will look under the computer desk for the cat first. This is because:
- When John left for school initially, he put the cat on the desktop under the computer desk.
- John was not aware that Mark later moved the cat behind the couch. So in John's mind, the cat should still be under the computer desk.
Therefore, when Mark calls John urgently and tells him to go home and take the cat to the company, John's first instinct will be to look under the computer desk for the cat, as that is where he thinks the cat is located.
If John does not find the cat under the computer desk and calls Mark back, John would likely say something like:
"The cat is not under the computer desk where I left it. Where did you put the cat?"
John would say this because Mark is the only other person mentioned in the story who could have moved the cat from its original spot under the computer desk. Since John does not find the cat there, the logical conclusion is that Mark must have moved the cat to a different location without telling John.
John's first instinct would be to check the location where he last remembers seeing the cat. Only after finding that the cat is not there would he realize that Mark must have moved it, and he would call Mark to ask where the cat was relocated to.
Does this explanation make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!

房间里有John，Mark，一只猫，一个箱子，一个篮筐，还有很多杂物。因为Mark要带猫去医院检查，John就把猫放到箱子里帮Mark做好准备。他放好后就离开房间去上学了。John走后，Mark觉得带箱子不方便，还是用篮筐来装猫。不过Mark有健忘症，他离开房间去上班的时候，把箱子放进了汽车后备箱。到了单位，急忙给John打电话，让John回家赶紧把猫送到他单位，要带猫去医院检查。说完这句就把电话挂了。John回到家，首先会到哪里找猫？最终John大概需要花多久能找到猫？

根据情景,可以分析如下:
1. 首先John会去看篮筐,检查Mark是否已经用篮筐装猫而不是箱子。
2. 若篮筐中没有猫,他会继续查看房间其他地方,包括箱子和其他杂物,寻找猫可能藏身的地方。
3. 最有可能的情况是,由于Mark健忘,他已经把装猫的箱子带到汽车后备箱了。
4. 若John首先查看篮筐没有结果,他需要花费一定时间仔细搜索整个房间。此外他还需要出门查看Mark的汽车,才能真正找到猫。
5. 综上,若猫只藏在箱子里而没有在房间里逃出来,John找到猫需要的时间大概在5-10分钟左右。
所以答案是:
首先John会先查看篮筐。若篮筐中没有猫,他需要花费5-10分钟搜索整个房间和Mark的汽车,才能最终找到被Mark忘在汽车后备箱中的猫。

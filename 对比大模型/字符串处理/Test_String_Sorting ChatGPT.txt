Given a string over an alphabet of fixed size (max length is 9 in our case), return the sorted string.
Here is an example, X is the input and Y is the output.
X = 421302214,  Y = 011222344
Please do the same operation of sorting for the following strings:
（1）X=389，Y=？
（2）X=0398，Y=？
（3）X=30983，Y=？
（4）X=830392，Y=？
（5）X=1120013，Y=？
（6）X=91910909，Y=？
（6）X=212100137，Y=？

To sort a string over an alphabet of fixed size, you can use any sorting algorithm. One commonly used algorithm is counting sort. Here's how you can apply counting sort to sort the given strings:

(1) X = 389
First, initialize a count array with the size of the alphabet (10 in this case) and initialize all elements to 0. Then, iterate through the string and count the occurrences of each digit.
Count array: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
Finally, reconstruct the sorted string by iterating through the count array and appending the digits based on their counts.
Y = 011233489

(2) X = 0398
Count array: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
Y = 00013988

(3) X = 30983
Count array: [1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Y = 00033889

(4) X = 830392
Count array: [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
Y = 000223389

(5) X = 1120013
Count array: [2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Y = 001112233

(6) X = 91910909
Count array: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6]
Y = 00001129999

(7) X = 212100137
Count array: [2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Y = 00001112237

Note: In counting sort, the count array's index represents the digit itself, and the count array's value represents the number of occurrences of that digit in the input string. The reconstructed sorted string is obtained by iterating through the count array in ascending order and appending the digit based on its count.

Please don't show me your algorithm, just output the final answer directly.

Apologies for the confusion. Here are the sorted strings directly:

(1) X = 389
Y = 011233489

(2) X = 0398
Y = 00013988

(3) X = 30983
Y = 00033889

(4) X = 830392
Y = 000223389

(5) X = 1120013
Y = 001112233

(6) X = 91910909
Y = 00001129999

(7) X = 212100137
Y = 00001112237

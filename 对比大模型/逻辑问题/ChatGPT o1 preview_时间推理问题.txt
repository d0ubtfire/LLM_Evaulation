张三、李四、王五三人相约17点在车站汇合。张三先到，1分钟后李四也到了，又过了2分钟王五才到。三人分别看自己的手表确认到达时间，张三说：“我刚才按时准点到的”，李四说：“我刚才比17点迟到了10分钟”，王五说：“我刚才比17点早到了3分钟”。但是实际上，三个人的手表显示比准确时间分别快了5分钟，慢了2分钟，慢了6分钟。

To solve this problem, we need to determine the actual time when Zhang San arrived at the station. Let's break down the information provided:

Agreement Time: All three agreed to meet at 17:00 (accurate time).

Watch Deviations:

Zhang San's watch is 5 minutes fast.
Li Si's watch is 2 minutes slow.
Wang Wu's watch is 6 minutes slow.
Arrival Statements:

Zhang San: "I arrived on time."
Li Si: "I was 10 minutes late compared to 17:00."
Wang Wu: "I arrived 3 minutes early compared to 17:00."
Arrival Intervals:

Li Si arrived 1 minute after Zhang San.
Wang Wu arrived 2 minutes after Li Si.
Step 1: Determine Zhang San's Actual Arrival Time

Since Zhang San says he arrived on time and his watch is 5 minutes fast, his watch showed 17:00 when he arrived. Therefore:

Actual time when Zhang San arrived=17:00−5 minutes=16:55
Actual time when Zhang San arrived=17:00−5 minutes=16:55
Answer: Zhang San arrived at 16:55 (accurate time).

问题：张三到达的实际准确时间？

To solve this problem, we'll determine the actual arrival time of Zhang San (张三) based on the given information. We have three people with watches that are off by different amounts:

- One watch is **5 minutes fast**.
- One watch is **2 minutes slow**.
- One watch is **6 minutes slow**.

The order of arrival and their statements are:

1. **Zhang San** arrives first and says, "I arrived exactly on time."
2. **Li Si** arrives 1 minute later and says, "I arrived 10 minutes late compared to 17:00."
3. **Wang Wu** arrives 2 minutes after Li Si (3 minutes after Zhang San) and says, "I arrived 3 minutes early compared to 17:00."

Let's denote:

- \( T_1 \): Actual arrival time of Zhang San.
- \( T_2 = T_1 + 1 \): Actual arrival time of Li Si.
- \( T_3 = T_1 + 3 \): Actual arrival time of Wang Wu.
- \( E_1, E_2, E_3 \): Time errors of Zhang San's, Li Si's, and Wang Wu's watches, respectively (positive if fast, negative if slow).

According to their statements:

1. Zhang San's watch shows \( T_1 + E_1 = 17:00 \).
2. Li Si's watch shows \( T_2 + E_2 = 17:10 \).
3. Wang Wu's watch shows \( T_3 + E_3 = 16:57 \).

From these, we derive:

1. \( T_1 = 17:00 - E_1 \).
2. \( T_1 + 1 = 17:10 - E_2 \) ⇒ \( T_1 = 17:09 - E_2 \).
3. \( T_1 + 3 = 16:57 - E_3 \) ⇒ \( T_1 = 16:54 - E_3 \).

Setting the expressions for \( T_1 \) equal to each other:

- \( 17:00 - E_1 = 17:09 - E_2 \) ⇒ \( E_2 - E_1 = 9 \).
- \( 17:00 - E_1 = 16:54 - E_3 \) ⇒ \( E_1 - E_3 = 6 \).

Now, we need to assign \( E_1, E_2, E_3 \) values from \(+5\), \(-2\), and \(-6\) minutes to satisfy:

1. \( E_2 - E_1 = 9 \).
2. \( E_1 - E_3 = 6 \).

After testing all possible combinations, we find:

- \( E_1 = -6 \) minutes (Zhang San's watch is 6 minutes slow).
- \( E_2 = +3 \) minutes (But +3 is not among the given errors).
  
Since \( +3 \) minutes is not one of the given errors, the problem seems unsolvable with the provided data. However, if we consider that perhaps Li Si's watch is actually \( +5 \) minutes fast, which is among the given errors, but then the equations don't satisfy.

**Conclusion:**

Given the information, it's impossible to determine Zhang San's actual arrival time because the provided data leads to inconsistent equations. There seems to be an error in the problem's data or insufficient information to reach a definitive answer.

**Answer:** The problem cannot be solved with the given information; Zhang San’s actual arrival time cannot be determined.
